# week3challenge1
Given a list containing integers, floats and one character strings, write a function that takes a list and returns a dictionary with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is a list of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers and chars is a list of sorted character strings.   list_sort([2,0,6,5,1,7,’z’,’a’])   # returns {‘evens’: [0,2,6], odds: [1,5,7], chars:[‘a’,’z’]}  In the listsort folder there are two files list_sort.py and list_sort_test.py, list_sort_test.py includes minimal tests for the challenge, implement list_sort() in list_sort.py to pass all the tests. Feel free to write more tests. Create a new repository for the solution and copy over the challenge files to the new repository. You are expected to use version control and share a link to the remote repository with your Learning facilitator for review.
